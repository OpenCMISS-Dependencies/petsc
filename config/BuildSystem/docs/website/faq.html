<h1 align="center">ASE FAQ&nbsp;</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Do you (or will you) support binary
    distribution of components?</font><br>
    This is very unlikely, since our experiments on Linux indicated that almost
    any small change in the OS or support software (Python version, g++ version)
    breaks binary compatibility (essentially the machine you build the component
    on has to be virtually identical to the machine you run it on).&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    Instead, we've adopted a source distribution model where the entire build
    process (downloading, configure, compiling, registering, etc) is handled
    cleanly by ASE</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Do you intend to support F77 as client
    and server languages?<br>
    </font>No, but we would assistant anyone interested in doing this. The <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components">LLNL
    Babel Team</a> does provide code generators for f77.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Are you compatible with the <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components">LLNL
    Babel Team</a> SIDL code generator?<br>
    </font>We are compatible at the source code level (see 1. regarding binary
    compatibility). We are developing software tools to make it trivial to move
    &quot;implementations&quot; between the Babel generated code and the ASE.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">How central to your plans is the use
    of SIDL?<br>
    </font>We are &quot;betting the farm on it&quot;<font color="#FF0000">. </font>We
    are rewriting all of PETSc to use SIDL and plan to do all future software
    development with SIDL.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font color="#FF0000">How come I have to &quot;buy
    into&quot; this enormous infrastructure to use your software; I'd like to
    take the one or two modules I need and no use the rest of the stuff?<br>
    </font>You are free to use as little or as much of the functionality of the
    libraries we provide as you like; for example, you can use our linear
    solvers but not our nonlinear solvers, through the use of dynamic libraries
    your application executable does not contain anything you do not use.<br>
    <br>
    However, it is not feasible to &quot;pull out&quot; of the libraries just
    the source code you use, the dependencies are just too complex. You would
    need to pull in all the error handling code, the profiling code, the dynamic
    loading code and the infrastructure to make that code portable and to
    compile it; at that point your application make environment will need to be
    as complicated and sophisticated as the ASE. Hence it is far better to treat
    the ASE components simply as libraries that you link against.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
