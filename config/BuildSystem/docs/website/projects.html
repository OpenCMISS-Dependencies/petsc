<p align="left">&nbsp;Write the code generator for C (suggest starting with the
Matlab generator and modify as needed)</p>

  </li>
  <li>

<p align="left">For each programming language add a new visitor that presents
the SIDL representation for THAT programming language. This would be used as
&quot;manual pages&quot;;&nbsp; for example, for C++ it would generate a class
definition (what normally goes in the .h file). Currently a user, working in say
Matlab, needs to consult the SIDL for a project they are using for calling
sequences of methods, (this requires they understand SIDL and its mapping to
Matlab) instead we want to present Matlab oriented documentation. These would be
put on the websites next to the SIDL.&nbsp;</p>
